That program will cypher and decypher the input and output/return the cyphered or decyphered result.


## Notions to reproduce:

- Cesar Cypher

## Definition of Done

- the program works perfectly after being tested out several times (I want to see the tests and results)

- Every and any choice made in the program (value type,keywords,local variables) must be documented and commented

P.S: Do not rush into using ai's for, tomorrow  you will have to write exactly the same code with no computer or help but your memory.
